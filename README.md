# Calculating-Similarity
Natural Language Processing Project...

In order to run the program, you need the nltk library and the dataset file.  
After running the program, it should display the similarities between the 
different vaccines in the dataset. It will display the names of the vaccines 
and what their similarity is. It uses TFIDF to reduce the weight of stopwords.
